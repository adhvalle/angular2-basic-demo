## Project Tools

- Angular 4.0.0-beta.1
- SASS
- Webpack

## Project Setup

#### Step 1: Package Manager

To install the project dependencies, you will need to install `yarn`. To install `yarn`, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

##### Step 2: Project Dependencies

You can do this by running:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install our dependencies for running the application.

To start the project:

```
yarn start
```

This will output some information about the project (such as the TypeScript version and build progress). Once you see "build completed", you are ready!

Open your browser to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to start running the code.
